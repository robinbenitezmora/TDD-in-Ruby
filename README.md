<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Test Drive Development with Ruby <a name="about-project"></a>

> This is a project to practice test-driven development with Ruby. The project is a simple creation of a class that will be evaluated by means of TDD (Test Driven Development).

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### <a name="tech-stack">
TDD with RSpec
</a>

> TDD is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
